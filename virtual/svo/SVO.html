 In this task you will be afterwards randomly paired with another person of the KD2 Pool,
    who is also participating in this study, and whom we will refer to as the <b>other</b>.
    This other person is someone you do not know and will remain mutually anonymous.
      <p>
        All of your choices are completely confidential.
    </p>
    <p>
    You will be making a series of decisions about allocating resources between you and this other person.
    For each of the following questions, please indicate the distribution you prefer most by marking the respective position along the <b>midline</b>.
    You can only make one mark for each question.
</p>
    <br>
    Your decisions will yield money for both yourself and the other person.
    In the example below, a person has chosen to distribute money so that he/she receives <b>€0.50,</b>
    while the anonymous other person receives <b>€0.40.</b>

    <p>
   There are no right or wrong answers, this is all about personal preferences.
    </p>
     <p>
    After you have made your decision, move the slider in that direction.
    As you can see, your choices will influence both the amount of money you receive as well as the amount of money the other receives.
  </p>
         <br>

     <br>
    For the final payout in this part, we will average all the answers you and the others provide,
    and then take the sum thereof.
    For example, if you allocate on average €0.60 to yourself and €0.30 to the other person,
    and the other person allocates on average €0.50 to themselves and €0.50 to you,
    taken together, you will earn an additional payout of €1.10,
    and the other person will earn an additional payout of €0.80.
